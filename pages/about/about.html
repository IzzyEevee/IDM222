        <h1 tabindex=0 >About Hannah Juraifani</h1>
        <p tabindex=0>My name is Hannah Sami Juraifani and I am an Interactive Digital Media major at Drexel University with a minor in Computer Science. I was born in Saudi Arabia
          and raised there for 13 years before moving to the US. I have a variety of interests including photography, art, and programming. I'm a fan of Pokemon, Anime (in general), Video Games
          (in general), Cartoons (in general), Eeveelutions, and Cats. These things inspire me to be more creative in both my art and in my work.</p>

        <p tabindex=0>In terms of my art, I have been drawing since, well, forever but in terms of professional, clean work I've been working on that since starting college.
          In this site, you'll see some pieces of my artwork in both in my free time and in my classes. </p>

        <p tabindex=0>In terms of my work, I am currently a beginner in web design. I hope by the time I graduate that I'll be proud of the work to show to
          my potential job offers. This website will showcase my work throughout my time here in college.</p>
